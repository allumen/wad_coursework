Heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Pierce the sweet potatoes a few times each and microwave on high for 5 mins until soft (alternatively, bake for 35-40 mins). Keep warm until ready to serve.
Heat half the oil in a frying pan and lightly brown the salmon on both sides – don’t worry about it being cooked through at this point. Transfer the salmon to a plate, wipe out the pan and heat the remaining oil. Cook the garlic for 30 seconds, without letting it brown, then add the spinach, lemon zest and juice and some seasoning. Stir in the mascarpone and 2 tbsp of the milk and cook until the spinach has wilted.
Tip the spinach mix into an ovenproof dish and top with the lemon slices and salmon fillets. Bake for 5-8 mins until the salmon is cooked through.
Meanwhile, scoop the sweet potato flesh from the skins and mash with the remaining milk and some seasoning. Serve the sweet potato mash alongside the salmon and creamy spinach.
